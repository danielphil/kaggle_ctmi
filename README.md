# kaggle_ctmi
Working with DICOM images from the [Kaggle CT Medical Images](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/siim-medical-images).

This is one of the simplest DICOM based datasets I could find. I'm taking the goal to be prediction of CT vs CTA.
My goal is to create a simple clean, short solution with a minimum of added 'infrastrcuture'

Download the dataset from Kaggle and put the `dicom_dir` folder at the same level as this README.md.
